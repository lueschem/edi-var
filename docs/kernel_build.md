# Kernel Build Instructions

The kernel build gets done automatically by
[this workflow](https://github.com/lueschem/edi-ci-public/blob/main/.github/workflows/kernel-build-var-som-mx8m-nano.yml).

The instructions are derived from the
[Variscite setup](https://variwiki.com/index.php?title=Debian_Build_Release&release=RELEASE_BULLSEYE_V1.0_VAR-SOM-MX8M-NANO)
and adapted so that a Debian package gets built.

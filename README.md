# edi-var

Debian tool chain and image generation for the Variscite imx8mn-var-som.

## Introduction

The edi configuration contained in this repository can be used to
generate the following artifacts:

* A Debian buster arm64 (64bit) image suitable for the Variscite imx8mn-var-som.
* A matching Mender update artifacts for the above configuration.
* An amd64/arm64 based LXD container with a pre-installed
cross development toolchain for C and C++.

## Important Note

Please note that image generation operations require superuser privileges
and therefore you can easily break your host operating system. Therefore
make sure that you have a backup copy of your data.

## Basic Usage

### Preparation

Prior to using edi-var you have to install [edi](https://www.get-edi.io)
according to
[this instructions](https://docs.get-edi.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).
Please take a careful look at the "Setting up ssh Keys" section since you
will need a proper ssh key setup in order to access the container or
the target device using ssh.

The image post processing commands require some additional tools. On
Ubuntu 20.04 those tools can be installed as follows:

``` bash
sudo apt install e2fsprogs bmap-tools mtools parted zerofree python3-sphinx mender-artifact
```

### Creating a Target Image

A target image can be created using the following command:

``` bash
sudo edi -v image create imx8mn-var-som-buster-arm64.yml
```

The resulting image can be copied to a SD card (here /dev/mmcblk0)
using the following command
(**Please note that everything on the SD card will be erased!**):

``` bash
sudo bmaptool copy artifacts/imx8mn-var-som-buster-arm64.img /dev/mmcblk0
```

If the command fails, unmount the SD card and repeat the above command.

Once you have booted the device using this SD card you can
access it using ssh (the access should be granted thanks to to your
ssh keys):

``` bash
ssh imx@IP_ADDRESS
```

The password for the user _imx_ is _ChangeMe!_ (just in case you want to
execute a command using `sudo` or login via a local terminal).

**Important: Do not flash the generated image to the eMMC yet - u-boot is missing!**

### Creating a Cross Development LXD Container

A cross development container can be created using the
following command:

``` bash
sudo edi -v lxc configure imx8mn-var-som-buster-arm64-cross-dev imx8mn-var-som-buster-arm64-cross-dev.yml
```

The container can be accessed as follows (the password is _ChangeMe!_):

``` bash
lxc exec imx8mn-var-som-buster-arm64-cross-dev -- login ${USER}
```

Or with ssh (Hint: retrieve IP_OF_CONTAINER with `lxc list`):

``` bash
ssh IP_OF_CONTAINER
```

You can directly start to cross compile applications:


``` bash
aarch64-linux-gnu-g++ ...
```

For your convenience, the LXD container shares the folder _edi-workspace_
with the host operating system.


## Documenting an Artifact

During the image build the documentation gets rendered to artifacts/CONFIGNAME_documentation
as reStructuredText. The text files can be transformed into a nice pdf file with some
additional tools that need to be installed first:

``` bash
sudo apt install texlive-latex-recommended texlive-pictures texlive-latex-extra latexmk
```

Then the pdf can be generated using the following commands:

``` bash
cd artifacts/CONFIGNAME_documentation
make latexpdf
```
